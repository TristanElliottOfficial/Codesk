## About Codesk

Codesk is an interactive community platform for programmers and designers to connect. I have noticed that there is no dedicated platform for developers and designers. It's always a social media platform that has a small section for developers and designers. Codesk is 100% free and will remain that way forever. We at Codesk are determined to provide the best platform for developers and designers to engage and interact with one another to form a new and exciting experience for development.
